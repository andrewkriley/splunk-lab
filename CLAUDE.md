# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common commands

```bash
# Start the lab
docker compose up -d

# Watch Splunk startup (ready when "Ansible playbook complete" appears)
docker compose logs -f splunk

# Stop containers (data preserved)
docker compose down

# Full reset — wipe all indexed data
docker compose down -v

# Rebuild the MCP server image after changes to mcp/Dockerfile
docker compose build splunk-mcp

# Check container health
docker compose ps
```

## Architecture

Two services run in Docker Compose:

- **splunk** (`splunk/splunk:latest`) — Splunk Enterprise. All ports bound to `127.0.0.1`. Data persisted in the `splunk-var` named volume. The `buttercup_app/` directory is bind-mounted into `/opt/splunk/etc/apps/buttercup_app` and auto-indexed on first boot.

- **splunk-mcp** (built from `mcp/Dockerfile`) — Official Splunk MCP server (`splunk-mcp-server` npm package). Runs in SSE mode on `127.0.0.1:8050`. Connects to Splunk via internal Docker networking on `splunk:8089`. No MCP endpoint auth — localhost-only by design.

## Buttercup app

`buttercup_app/` is a minimal Splunk app that auto-ingests sample data:

- `default/inputs.conf` — `monitor://` stanzas that tell Splunk to watch the `data/` directory
- `default/props.conf` — CSV parsing config for the two CSV sourcetypes
- `data/` — the actual sample files (`access.log`, `vendor_sales.csv`, `products.csv`)

Data lands in the `main` index under sourcetypes `access_combined`, `buttercup_sales`, and `buttercup_products`.

## Environment variables

All runtime config lives in `.env` (gitignored). See `.env.example` for the full reference. The only required variable is `SPLUNK_PASSWORD`. `SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN` pre-sets the HEC token so it's known before boot.

## Security posture

This lab is intentionally insecure for local demo use:
- All ports are `127.0.0.1`-only
- MCP endpoint has no authentication
- `VERIFY_SSL=false` on the MCP→Splunk connection

Do not change port bindings to `0.0.0.0` without adding authentication.
